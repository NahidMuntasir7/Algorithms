// You are given the arrival times arr[] and departure times dep[] of all trains that arrive at a railway station on the same day. 
// Your task is to determine the minimum number of platforms required at the station to ensure that no train is kept waiting.

// At any given time, the same platform cannot be used for both the arrival of one train and the departure of another. 
// Therefore, when two trains arrive at the same time, or when one arrives before another departs, additional platforms are required to accommodate both trains.

// Examples:

// Input: arr[] = [900, 940, 950, 1100, 1500, 1800], dep[] = [910, 1200, 1120, 1130, 1900, 2000]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: There are three trains during the time 9:40 to 12:00. So we need a minimum of 3 platforms.



// more than one plartform needed when it is intersecting
// so need to find out maximum number of intersections
