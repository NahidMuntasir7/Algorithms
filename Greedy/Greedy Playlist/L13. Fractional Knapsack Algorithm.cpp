// Problem Statement: The weight of N items and their corresponding values are given. We have to put these items in a knapsack of weight W such that the total value obtained is maximized.
// Note: We can either take the item as a whole or break it into smaller units.

// Example:
// Input: N = 3, W = 50, values[] = {100,60,120}, weight[] = {20,10,30}.

// Output: 240.00
// Explanation: The first and second items  are taken as a whole  while only 20 units of the third item is taken. Total value = 100 + 60 + 80 = 240.00
