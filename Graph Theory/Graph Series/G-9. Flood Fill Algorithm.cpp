// Problem Statement: An image is represented by a 2-D array of integers, each integer representing the pixel value of the image. Given a coordinate (sr, sc) 
// representing the starting pixel (row and column) of the flood fill, and a pixel value newColor, "flood fill" the image.

// To perform a "flood fill", consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same colour as the starting pixel, 
// plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same colour as the starting pixel), and so on. 
// Replace the colour of all of the aforementioned pixels with the newColor.
