// Given a DAG, find the shortest path from the source to all other nodes in this DAG. In this problem statement, we 
// have assumed the source vertex to be ‘0’. You will be given the weighted edges of the graph.

// Note: What is a DAG ( Directed Acyclic Graph)?
// A Directed Graph (containing one-sided edges) having no cycles is said to be a Directed Acyclic Graph.
