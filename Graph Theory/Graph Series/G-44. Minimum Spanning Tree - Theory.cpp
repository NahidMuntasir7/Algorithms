Spanning Tree:
A spanning tree is a tree in which we have N nodes(i.e. All the nodes present in the original graph) and N-1 edges and all nodes are reachable from each other.

MST:
A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted graph that connects all the vertices together without any cycles 
and with the minimum possible total edge weight.
