// Given are the two distinct words startWord and targetWord, and a list denoting wordList of unique words of equal lengths. Find the length of the shortest transformation sequence from startWord to targetWord.

// In this problem statement, we need to keep the following conditions in mind:

// A word can only consist of lowercase characters.
// Only one letter can be changed in each transformation.
// Each transformed word must exist in the wordList including the targetWord.
// startWord may or may not be part of the wordList

// Note:  If thereâ€™s no possible way to transform the sequence from startWord to targetWord return 0.
