// Problem Statement: A directed graph of V vertices and E edges is given in the form of an adjacency list adj. 
// Each node of the graph is labeled with a distinct integer in the range 0 to V - 1. 
// A node is a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a safe node if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node.
// You have to return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. The answer should be sorted in ascending order.
