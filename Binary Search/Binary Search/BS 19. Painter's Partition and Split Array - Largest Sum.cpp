// Painter's Partition Problem

// Given an array/list of length ‘n’, where the array/list represents the boards and each element of the given array/list represents the length of each board. 
// Some ‘k’ numbers of painters are available to paint these boards. Consider that each unit of a board takes 1 unit of time to paint.
// You are supposed to return the area of the minimum time to get this job done of painting all the ‘n’ boards under a constraint that 
// any painter will only paint the continuous sections of boards.

// Example :
// Input: arr = [2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3], k = 2
// Output: 11
