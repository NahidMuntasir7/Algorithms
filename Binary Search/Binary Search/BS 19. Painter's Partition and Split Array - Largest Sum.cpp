// Painter's Partition Problem

// Given an array/list of length ‘n’, where the array/list represents the boards and each element of the given array/list represents the length of each board. 
// Some ‘k’ numbers of painters are available to paint these boards. Consider that each unit of a board takes 1 unit of time to paint.
// You are supposed to return the area of the minimum time to get this job done of painting all the ‘n’ boards under a constraint that 
// any painter will only paint the continuous sections of boards.

// Example :
// Input: arr = [2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3], k = 2
// Output: 11


// Largest Subarray Sum Minimized

// Given an integer array ‘A’ of size ‘N’ and an integer ‘K'.
// Split the array ‘A’ into ‘K’ non-empty subarrays such that the largest sum of any subarray is minimized.
// Your task is to return the minimized largest sum of the split.
// A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.

// Example:
// Input: ‘N’ = 5, ‘A’ = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], ‘K’ = 3
// Output: 6

// Explanation: There are many ways to split the array ‘A’ into K consecutive subarrays. 
// The best way to do this is to split the array ‘A’ into [1, 2, 3], [4], and [5], where the largest sum among the three subarrays is only 6.
