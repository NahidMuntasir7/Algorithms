// Problem statement:
// Given an array ‘arr’ of integer numbers, ‘arr[i]’ represents the number of pages in the ‘i-th’ book.
// There are ‘m’ number of students, and the task is to allocate all the books to the students.

// Allocate books in such a way that:
// 1. Each student gets at least one book.
// 2. Each book should be allocated to only one student.
// 3. Book allocation should be in a contiguous manner.

// You have to allocate the book to ‘m’ students such that 
// the maximum number of pages assigned to a student is minimum.

// (max) min

// If the allocation of books is not possible, return -1.

// Example:
// Input: ‘n’ = 4 ‘m’ = 2 
// ‘arr’ = [12, 34, 67, 90]
// Output: 113
