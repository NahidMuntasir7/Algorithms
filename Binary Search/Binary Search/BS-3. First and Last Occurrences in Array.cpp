// first and last occurance of a given number

// first occurence = lower bound
// last  occurence = upper bound - 1

// edge cases

// first occurence and last occurence

// logic: if lb == n: the element is not present so, if not present then no first last 
// if lb present may not be equal to x

// if lb is present and equal to x.. then always, last occ = ub - 1 think..

  if(lb == n or arr[lb] != x) lb and ub not present
