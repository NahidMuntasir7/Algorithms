// You are given 'n' roses and you are also given an array 'arr' where 'arr[i]' denotes that the 'ith' rose will bloom on the 'arr[i]th' day.
// You can only pick already bloomed roses that are adjacent to make a bouquet. You are also told that you require exactly 'k' adjacent bloomed roses to make a single bouquet.
// Find the minimum number of days required to make at least 'm' bouquets each containing 'k' roses. Return -1 if it is not possible.

// Example :
// Input: n = 9,  arr = [ 1, 2, 1, 2, 7, 2, 2, 3, 1 ], k = 3, m = 2
// Output: 3
